= Hystrix Examples -- and a little bit more

This started as a show case for Hystrix. As more tools have been added it might
also look for you as a walk through for different tools. Take a look around
and see what might fit your development environment.

== Hystrix: Make your application resilient

=== Build your application to handle the failure of external services

Your application has external runtime dependencies, like an external
validating service for data your user has entered, or the central CRM
of your company.

What will happen to your application when this external service has a problem?

In the worst case your application will become unavailable as well: The
screens of your application will freeze and not respond as the external
system doesn't return with a response. Users and IT operations will call you
because they think it's your fault and don't suspect the external service.

But what should your application do, when the external service is unavailable?

. Provide timely responses to the users.
. Give a detailed error message to the users.
. Provide fall backs when the other service is down.
. Hooks for IT operations for monitoring to pin-point the problematic service.
. Prevent overloading of the problematic service to avoid domino effects.
. Automatic recovery once the problematic service is online again.

=== What Hystrix has built in ready-to-use

These problems are not new. Netflix has solved them for their video on demand service. In 2012 they made their solution open source.

To deliver the above, Hystrix has built in the following defaults:

. Timeout for every request to an external system (default: 1000 ms)
. Limit of concurrent requests for external system (default: 10)
. Circuit breaker to avoid further requests (default: when more than 50% of all requests fail)
. Retry of a single request after circuit breaker has triggered (default: every 5 seconds)
. Interfaces to retrieve runtime information on request and aggregate level (there's even a ready-to-use realtime dashboard for it)

It also shows you where you can place you fall back code.

Providing a detailed error message is then still a task for you.

For more details please have a look at http://hystrix.github.com. The https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki[wiki] gives detailed information how to use it and the mechanisms inside.

=== Hystrix at work

To seek Hystrix at work in an example application I've built a REST application that will be put under load soon. Let's start out with the scenario first.

== Prerequisites for this tutorial

=== Java SDK installed

In order to run this application you'll need to have Java installed. The minimum recommended version is Java JDK 7. I have performed my tests with Java JDK 8. Please download it from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle Java SE Download page^].

=== Internet Connection for additional downloads

In the process of the turorial you'll need to download additional files from the internet. This includes i.e. Apache Tomcat and Apache Maven. All installations are scripted using small Powershell scripts. Expect a download an additional 100 MB during the tutorial.

=== Proxy settings

When using Maven behind a proxy, please setup your proxy for protocols http and https in `tools\maven\apache-maven-3.2.x\conf\settings.xml`. You should specify the username and password only when this is necessary in your configuration. Please leave it blank otherwise. Please ensure that `localhost` is listed in `nonProxyHosts` otherwise the automatic deployment to the locally installed tomcat might not work.

=== Virtual Box and Vagrant

To show advanced dashboards and monitoring you'll need to install both http://virtualbox.org/[Oracle Virtual^] Box and http://www.vagrantup.com/[HashiCorp Vagrant^]. These will allow you to spin up virtual machines to run both Zabbix and Riemann on your local machine. Expect to download an additional 1-1.5 GB for the two tools, an image of a virtual machine and additional packages.

== Scenario to challenge Hystrix: External Bank validation

=== IBAN and BIC validations

Most of Europe have changed to SEPA in early 2014. Instead of national account number and bank sorting code you now have a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBAN[IBAN] (International Bank Account Number) and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9362[BIC] (Bank Identifier Code).

When customers enter their bank details on your website, you want to validate these. As the IBAN includes a check digit, you can implement this check.
The BIC doesn't have a check digit, so you can only verify it by lookup in a dictionary.

Things get messy as the BIC might not match the IBAN, or the IBAN might
not be valid for direct debit/clearing.

The good news: There are external services that do the validation for you.

=== Simulating an external IBAN/BIC validation service

As we want to show what Hystrix can do for us, we need a IBAN/BIC
validation service. We simulate the behaviour with a small Java procedure:

[source,java]
.IBANValidator.java
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/base/IBANValidator.java[tags=classdef]
----

The core of the simulation is the static `isValid()` method. As it is synchronized, it will validate one account at a time.

To simulate the processing, we use `Thread.sleep()`. The delay is by default 100 ms. This can be configured at runtime using an `DynamicLongProperty`. See the chapter <<archaius>> below. Changing the delay at runtime will help us later to try out different scenarios.

When someone interrupts the thread while waiting for the `synchronized` lock or for `Thread.sleep()`, the method will throw an `InterruptedException`.

This is a standard Java feature that will be used by Hystrix to notify a service call that is taking too long.

You find this source code in the `hystrix-application` folder.

== Behaviour of Hystrix under load

=== Introduction to Load Scenarios for Hystrix

Now we have a complete setup: an application, a driver for the load and a real time dashboard. You are now ready to see the behaviour of Hystrix.

The number of threads in JMeter will remain constant for all scenarios. The scenarios will differ only in their setting of `hystrixdemo.sleep` in `archaius.properties`. This will simulate an IBAN/BIC validation that is gradually getting slower and slower.

The delay between requests in the thread pool is 1 second. The time of the service to respond is not compensated by the delay: The longer the response time is, the fewer requests per second we will see. When there is no delay at all, we would see 20 requests per second, as we have 20 workers.

=== A fast response: 10 ms

Starting with a response time of 10 ms we see a very well behaving system: The throughput is about 18 requests per second.

The number of active threads is idling between one and two. The median service time is about 10 ms, the mean slightly above.

.Hystrix Dashboard: 10 ms service delay
image::dashboard_10ms.png[Hystrix Dashboard: 10 ms service delay]

=== A medium response: 70 ms

Now change the delay to 70 ms. Save the file. Archaius will pick up the new value within a second. Our IBAN/BIC service will get slower.

You will see an immediate effect on the Dashboard. After a short time the values in the dashboard will be re-calculated.

.Hystrix Dashboard: 70 ms service delay
image::dashboard_70ms.png[Hystrix Dashboard: 70 ms service delay]

With 13.6 requests per second and a delay of 70 ms in the service is now saturated. 13.7 req/s multiplied with 70 ms is almost 1 second working time per second.

You also see that the number of active threads has increased to 6.

=== A late response: 100 ms

Change the delay to 100 ms. Save the file. You'll see the dashboard change.

.Hystrix Dashboard: 100 ms service delay
image::dashboard_100ms.png[Hystrix Dashboard: 100 ms service delay]

The number of active threads iterates between 9 and 10. (Please ignore the "queue size", this is not active as queueing is disabled by default). Indicated as a yellow number some requests receive a time out while they are waiting at the synchronized lock on the simulated IBAN server. Purple indicates the number of requests that are rejected when there is no space in the queue.

The dashboard shows you that 26 percent of all requests fail.

If the service wouldn't have been wrapped as a service, we would see an overload situation and with long response times. With Hystrix the response times in the 99 percent tier are still around one second for the successful requests.

The circuit is closed, meaning that Hystrix considers the service to be functional (although some requests are rejected).

=== A critical response: 200 ms

Now try 200 ms. Save the file. The dashboard will change again.

You'll see that the Circuit changes between open and closed. Therefore the following picture is a combination of two screen shots.

.Hystrix Dashboard: 200 ms service delay
image::dashboard_200ms.png[Hystrix Dashboard: 200 ms service delay]

The ratio of failed commands is now more than 50 percent, therefore the circuit breaker kicks in. Every five seconds it tries on request (that is answered within 200 ms), resets the statistics and then closes again.

As the statistics are reset on each opening circuit, you can't trust the dashboard. Please have a look in JMeter in the Summary report. Reset it (as it will by now contain results from the previous setups) and wait a short time. It will show you that about 65 percent of the requests fail.

=== An eternity: 1500 ms

The final setting: 1500 ms. Save the file. Watch the dashboard.

.Hystrix Dashboard: 1500 ms service delay
image::dashboard_1500ms.png[Hystrix Dashboard: 1500 ms service delay]

As the time out is 1000 ms for the commands, 100 percent of the requests fail. The circuit is now permanently open. Even the retry every 5 seconds will not close it again as this single request is too slow.

=== Hystrix: Don't waste resources by queueing requests

The examples show that Hystrix does its job very effectively:

. It  will forward as many requests as possible to the service to process them.
. Any other requests are returned to the sender as unsuccessful as early as possible.
. No caller waits longer than the 1 second time out for a response.
. Queues require resources and Hystrix efficiently minimizes queueing inside the system. It is limited by default to ten concurrent requests processed by the thread pool.
. A burst in requests is reflected at the earliest boundary instead of overloading the backend service.
. When the back end services are overloaded for one or the other reason, the circuit breaker in front will give the backend services a break to recover.

Well done, Hystrix!

Please feel free to try your own variations: enable queueing, change the number of threads, or try out any other Hystrix setting.
