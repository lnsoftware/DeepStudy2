== Putting your application under load

=== Apache JMeter is free and open source load testing

http://jmeter.apache.org/[Apache JMeter^] allows you to create
and run load tests simulating the load of multiple users using
a single PC.

=== Installing Apache JMeter

This process has been automated for you. The first time you start `tools/maven/run-jmeter.bat` JMeter is downloaded and installed.

The following defaults are applied:

. Whenever you run JMeter using the script above, the load testing script `hystrixSaveAccount.jmx` is opened.

You will see the <<img-jmeterwelcome>>.

=== Simulating multiple users

You can vary the number of simulated users by changing the number of threads. In this script the number of users is configured to be 20.

A test with JMeter has the following steps:

. choose the number of users (aka threads)
. press the play image:jmeter-play.png[Play, title="Play"] button to start the workers
. press the stop image:jmeter-stop.png[Stop, title="Stop"] button to stop the workers
. Watch the summary report to see the timing of the requests and how many requests succeed and fail
. Watch the log file of Apache Tomcat for exceptions and other log messages
. Change the Archaius runtime configuration and see how the behaviour of the system changes (see section <<archaius>> for the details).
. press the clean image:jmeter-clean.png[Clean, title="Clean"] button to clear the results from JMeter

[IMPORTANT]
When you change the number of users (aka threads) it will become effective only after you stop/start the workers.
