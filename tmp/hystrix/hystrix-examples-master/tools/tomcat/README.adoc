== Starting up the application container

=== Apache Tomcat is is an easy to use servlet container

http://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat] is a servlet container. It can run JavaEE Web applications like our JAX-RS applications.

Tomcat Version 8 is implementing the JavaEE 7 standard supporting
the latest APIs.

=== Installing and running Apache Tomcat

Installation is straight forward: After the download only few
configuration steps are necessary.

All of these have been prepared in the script `tools/tomcat/run-tomcat.bat`. When you start it the first time, the the script will download the installation archive, unzip it and update the configuration.

==== Activated Apache Tomcat features

The following features are being set up using the automatic installation:

In `setenv.bat`:

. Allow Java remote debugging on port 1044 +
[source]
-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1044

In `context.xml`:

. Activate `antiResourceLocking` to allow hot-deployment of applications when running Microsoft Windows as operating system

In `tomcat-users.xml`:

. Setup an user `deploy` with password `deploy` to automatically deploy an application.
. Setup an user `tomcat` with password `tomcat` to allow login on the management GUI.

==== Testing the Apache Tomcat installation

To test the application point your browser at http://localhost:8080. You should see an Apache Tomcat start page with the welcome message (see figure <<img-tomcatwelcome>>).

[[img-tomcatwelcome]]
.Apache Tomcat Welcome Message

Click on the button *Manager App* and you will be asked for a user name and password. Use the user `tomcat` with the password stated above to log in.

== Using runtime configuration

=== Runtime configuration will get you credits

If you would write applications that would require a restart every
time you change a setting, it will deter your users as you will have
a downtime.

How nice if you could change all your settings at runtime! No more night shifts for IT operating to change parameters and restart the services!

=== Netflix Archaius to the rescue

Hystrix is integrated already with  https://github.com/Netflix/archaius[Archaius^] that handles runtime
configuration for you. When implementing `IBANValidator` you've seen the dynamic property being introduced:

[source,java,indent=0]
.IBANValidator.java
----
include::../{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/base/IBANValidator.java[tags=dynprop]
----

This will create a dynamic property. When it's being accessed, it will always return the most up to date value for it. When the external configuration doesn't define a value the default of 100 will be returned.

In more advanced situations you can also register a callback to be notified whenever a configuration changes. Please refer to the https://github.com/Netflix/archaius/wiki[Archaius Wiki^] to find out more about it.

=== How runtime configuration works in this project

Archaius supports multiple back ends to store configuration data. In this setup all configuration is stored in a Java properties file. Archaius checks this file every second.

This is configured as follows:

[source]
.setenv.bat
----
-Darchaius.configurationSource.additionalUrls=file:///%CATALINA_HOME%/../archaius.properties
-Darchaius.fixedDelayPollingScheduler.delayMills=1000
-Darchaius.fixedDelayPollingScheduler.initialDelayMills=1000
----

This allows you to change the dynamic:

[source]
.archaius.properties
hystrixdemo.sleep=10

This will override the default setting with 10.

=== Configuring the Hystrix command via Archaius

All Hystrix settings can be configured on default and on command level. Please refer to the https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration[Configuration Wiki of Hystrix] for an in-depth discussion. This will now show the core parameters and configure them on default level:

[source]
.archaius.properties
----
include::archaius.properties[tags=hystrixcommand]
----

To give these parameters a try you should set up a load test. You'll see in the next chapter how you can do this. But first deploy the application to this freshly installed Tomcat!
