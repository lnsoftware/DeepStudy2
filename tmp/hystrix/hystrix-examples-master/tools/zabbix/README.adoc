== Long term monitoring of Hystrix metrics

=== Zabbix as classic long term monitoring and notification

http://zabbix.com/[Zabbix^] is a classic monitoring system. It is stable and it has grown over several iterations. It supports a REST API out of the box.

All data is stored in a database. The server polls information from clients, runs commands or receives information from agents.

A frontend service will provide a web interface that includes configuration, monitoring and graphing capabilities.

=== Installing and running Zabbix

The installation has been scripted as a http://vagrantup.com[Vagrant^] script. This will first download a linux image of CentOS and spin it up in http://virtualbox.org/[Virtualbox^]. Then it will hand over to a provisioner, in our case this is http://saltstack.com/[Saltstack^].

To install Vagrant please see <<vagrant>>. Once it is installed,
run the follwing command in `tools/zabbix`:

----
vagrant up
----

This will take a while to download all the files necessary. Once it is up and running point your browser at your local Zabbix installation: http://localhost:2280/zabbix.

Use Username `Admin` password `zabbix` to log in (please not the capital *A* in the user name)

=== Configuration of Zabbix

All configuration items could be automated using the REST API. This will be a future task for this tutorial.

// TODO

For now these are the manual steps:

. In menu:Configuration[Templates] click on btn:[Import]. Pick the file `hystrix_template.xml` from `tools\zabbix`. Click on btn:[Import].
. Choose menu:Configuration[Templates] again. You see a `hystrixTemplate` here. Click on this template to edit it. Include the host `hystrix` in group `Discovered Hosts` in the shuttle view to put it on the left side. This will apply the template to the host. Click on btn:[Save].
. In menu:Configuration[Host] click on btn:[Create Host]. Enter `hystrix` as host name here. Pick `Discovered Hosts` as the Host group. Now btn:[Save].

This is all configuration that is needed: You have created a host, and you have associated it with a template that will autodiscover all Hystrix comamnds.

=== Configuration of the example application

As default the Zabbix agent in the application is disabled. To enable it, go to the file `archaius.properties`. Change the `hystrixdemo.enablezabbix` to be true.

The change is active at runtime. This will trigger the activation in `HystrixSetupListener`.

=== Zabbix autodiscovery at work

The following steps will now happen automatically:

. The Zabbix agent will connect to `127.0.0.1:10051` and identifies itself as host `hystrix`. In our example this is hardcoded.
. The Zabbix agent asks the server for any scheduled checks. The only check that is configured for the host `hystrix` is the `hystrixCommand.discovery` in the template.
. The agent runs the check and delivers all active Hystrix commands as a JSON object to the server.
. This will trigger the auto discovery. For every command Zabbix will create 20 items and three graphs.
. When the Zabbix agent reloads the list of checks after a minute, there will be a lot more checks. It will run them as specified in the interval of the template we imported to Zabbix.

The auto discovery rule is set to run every five seconds. Please note that the auto discovery will only find commands that have been triggered at least once during the runtime of the application. Hystrix will only notify our Zabbix agent at the first created command.

Please choose menu:Configuration[Hosts] and you should see the number of Items change for the host `hystrix`. Please refresh your browser if necessary.

Now choose menu:Monitoring[Graphs] and choose the host `hystrix` and any of the three graphs. After a few minutes you should see the first graphs appearing. The following screen shows a service that was answering successfully first. After a short time the response time was changed to 250 ms. Soon lots of rejected and timeout requests appear.

Zabbix polls for the command data every minute. Change the timing in `archaius.properties` to see information about failed requests.

Click on menu:Monitoring[Latest data] to see the latest values that the agent has sent.

=== Java classes to forward information from Hystrix to Zabbix

In order to activate the forwarding of events, you'll need to change `hystrixdemo.enablezabbix` to `true` in `archaius.properties`.
This change will be active immediately.

The property `hystrixdemo.enablezabbix` in `archaius.properties` is evaluated in the class `HystrixSetupListener`. When this property is enabled, the Zabbix agent is started.

You find all additional classes in the package `de.ahus1.hystrix.util.zabbix` in the example application. The following classes work together to forward the information to Zabbix:

. `ZabbixCommandMetricsProvider` is registered with Zabbix. It handles the connection to Zabbix. It creates a callback `ZabbixCommandMetricsProvider` that will be called by the agent when it requires data for the provider `hystrixCommand`. It creates for Zabbix on request a `HystrixZabbixMetricsPublisherCommand` when a command is created for the first time.
. Once the `HystrixZabbixMetricsPublisherCommand` initialized, it registers itself with the `ZabbixCommandMetricsProvider`.
. The `ZabbixCommandMetricsProvider` will provide a list of HystrixCommand keys when it is called with `hystrixCommand.discovery` When it is called `hystrixCommand.countSuccess[{#COMMAND}]` it returns the current count of successful Hystrix command calls.

The current implementation doesn't return any information about thread pools yet.

=== Working with templates in Zabbix

When you change your template, the changes are applied to all hosts assigned to the template. This makes it easy to ensure a common configuration of all Hystrix commands throughout your infrastructure.

You can also choose to setup triggers automatically.

When a command is no longer used in your application, the auto discovery will no longer return it to Hystrix. Hystrix will remove all items that are no longer needed after 30 days. You can simulate this behaviour by stopping/starting the tomcat server and not sending any requests via JMeter. As now commands will be triggered, the list of auto-discovered commands is empty. A few seconds later Zabbix will add a yellow exclamation mark to your items and will start the 30 day countdown.
